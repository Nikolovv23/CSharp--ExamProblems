﻿// Your task is to create a mail repository by implementing the following classes.
// Mail
// You are given a class Mail with the following properties:
// •	Sender – string
// •	Receiver - string
// •	Body - string
// The class constructor should receive sender, receiver, and body. 
// •	Override the ToString() method in the following format:
// "From: {sender} / To: {receiver}
// Message: { body}
// "
// 
// MailBox
// Next, you have a MailBox class that contains Inbox and Archive (collections for storing mails). All entries inside the repository have the same properties. The MailBox class should have the following properties:
// •	Capacity - int
// •	Inbox – List<Mail>
// •	Archive – List<Mail>
// 
// The class constructor should receive capacity and initialize the Inbox and Archive with new instances of the collections. 
// Implement the following features:
// •	Method IncomingMail(Mail mail) – adds an entry to the Inbox collection, if the Capacity allows it.
// •	Method DeleteMail(string sender) – Finds and removes the first mail from the Inbox by a given sender, if such exists, and returns boolean (true if it is removed, otherwise – false)
// •	Method ArchiveInboxMessages() – The method moves all inbox mails to the Archive. Returns the number of mails moved.
// •	Method GetLongestMessage() – returns the ToString() method of the Mail with the longest Body.
// •	Method InboxView() – returns a string in the following format:
// o   "Inbox:
// {Mail1}
// { Mail2}
// {…}
// { Mailn}
// "
// Constraints
// •	You will always have mails added before receiving commands manipulating the collections in the MailBox.
// •	The Capacity property is related to the Inbox only.
